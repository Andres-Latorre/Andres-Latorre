## About Me
I am an Economist with a strong interest in data analytics and evidence-based decision making.  
Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Analytics, where I combine my background in economics with programming, data analysis, and visualization tools.

My professional and academic interests focus on:
- Social and circular economy
- Public policy analysis
- Impact evaluation
- Data-driven insights for decision making

I enjoy working with data to understand real-world economic and social problems and to translate complex information into clear and actionable insights.
